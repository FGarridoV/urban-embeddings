# Urban embeddings

This is the official repository for creating urban space embeddings based on street-level imagery (SLI) and human similarity judgments. This repository compiles all the coded required for developing urban space embedding. It has three main steps: (1) Spatial unit definition, (2) Urban similarity experiment and (3) Urban embedding modeling. Each step is structured in independet repository allowing to clone them indivdually. For further information please see our publication. Please cite properly this work on: [...]
